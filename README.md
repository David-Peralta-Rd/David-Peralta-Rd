## 🙋 About me

I'm a backend apprentice with a clear goal: to become a software engineer specialized in artificial intelligence and big data. I'm training with real projects, constant practice, and a lot of documentation reading. I don't have all the answers, but I'm committed to learning from the ground up.

I currently use Python as my primary language and focus on building clean, scalable, and data-driven solutions.
